# amod-4901

This repo contains a simple programming language for Trent's AMOD-4901 course. The compiler is based off the expresso language from MIT's 2002 version of [SMA-5502](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/35804/6-035Fall-2002/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-035Computer-Language-EngineeringFall2002/CourseHome/index.htm).

## Getting Started

### Requirements
Below is a list of required software dependencies that must be installed on your system in order to compile and run the project:
* .NET SDK 6 (required)
  * The entire compiler is written in cSharp and as such .NET is necessary in order to run and compile any project.
* [ANTLR Toolkit](https://www.antlr.org/download.html) (semi-required)
  * This is a parsing and lexing framework equivlant to JLEX and CUP, the tooling is required in order to generate the lexer and parser for building the compiler.
* Taskfile (semi-optional)
  * Taskfile is a general language agnostic task system that we use for running shell commands it let's us run simple shell commands such as `task` to build the entire compiler without having to use something like `make` or `.sh` files allowing for better cross platform use. If you do not have taskfile installed the compiler can be build by copying the commands directly and running them in bash, or the corresponding commands on whatever platform your using.

### Dependencies
* [CommandLineParser](https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline)
  * This is a simple library for building a command line application it makes the options system nice and easy to use.
* [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/)
  * This is used for parsing and lexing.
* [Verify](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify)
  * This library is used for snapshot testing.

### Building
The compiler can be built using the command `task build`, alternatively it can be built and run using `task` which both builds and runs the program.

#### TODO: Usage

### Testing

The compiler uses `MSTest` and [`Verify`](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify) for testing. 

Tests can be run using `task test`, you can use `task test -- --filter <query>` to run specific tests.

### Extra Commands
* `task format` - This can be used to format the entire compiler and test suite.
* `task clean` - This can be used to clean up any artifacts generated by the compiler.

## TODO:
This section contains a list of general TODO's left on the project:
* Lexing
  * More Unit Tests
* Parsing
  * Figure out error handling
  * Testing
    * Operator Precedence
    * Kitchen Soup
    * Targeted Tests
* Admin
  * Simple bash scripts for the most basic tasks.
  * Github Actions
    * It would be nice if we ran both a formatting check and our test suite in github actions on commit.
